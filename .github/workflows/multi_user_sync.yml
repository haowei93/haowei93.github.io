  # After sync, trigger the build/deploy workflow
  # We can't use `needs` directly if the deploy workflow is separate.
  # But we can call the deploy workflow if it's reusable, or just let the push above trigger it if configured.
  # Since we pushed to the branch, if gh-pages.yml is configured to run on push to this branch, it will trigger.
  # BUT: pushes from GITHUB_TOKEN often don't trigger other workflows.
  # WORKAROUND: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for the push, or just inline the build step here.
  # Let's inline the build and deploy steps for simplicity in this branch testing phase.
  
  build_and_deploy:
    needs: sync
    # Only deploy if sync succeeded. 
    # Actually, we might want to deploy even if sync didn't change anything, 
    # but usually we rely on the commit triggering a separate workflow or we do it here.
    # Since we can't easily trigger the other workflow without a PAT, let's include deployment here.
    
    # Wait. gh-pages.yml handles deployment. 
    # If we want to test deployment from this branch, we should ensure gh-pages.yml listens to it.
    # We already modified gh-pages.yml? Let's check.
    # The user's gh-pages.yml uses `workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch`. It DOES NOT listen to push!
    # So we need to call it or duplicate logic.
